# image-converter
This is a image converter to convert .png files into .jpg

<h1> How to use this? </h1>
<p> Just run the .exe and select your settings in the "settings" tab. Then go to convert and select a path. Now you can convert your files! :)</p>

<h1> Why did you do this? </h1>
<p> I've coded this to learn more about the Windows-API and get a bit more familiar with DirectX.</p>
<p> Keep in mind, that this is not the best code. I'm still learning and trying my best.</p>

<h1>Notes </h1>
<p> I've also followed a tutorial from a youtube series to get the directX stuff working.</p>
